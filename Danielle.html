    <p>Just like most other people, you also have a vacuum cleaner to get rid of dust and dirt to make sure that your home is clean and free from bacteria and germs. You probably know that vacuum cleaners come in all shapes and sizes, but did you know that there are 10 interesting facts about the vacuum cleaner that you might not be aware of? These include:</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The first vacuum cleaner was invented in 1866, by Ives W McGaffney, and worked by using a hand crank! The crank helped to suck air up through a tube. The cranking caused a significant difference in the air pressure, resulting in the atmospheric pressure pushing air on the surface, back up into the tube. This, therefore, meant that the cleaner could suck up debris and dirt off the floor, up to the end of the tube. The invention had only got so far, however, so the dirt and debris it sucked up was simply distributed from one place to another, through vents in the cleaner.</li>
        <li>Just about every home has one! In the 1930s, only around 30% of homes had a vacuum cleaner. These days, they are found in about 98% of homes! The device has certainly come a long way since those early days!</li>
        <li> Its popularity with the working class increased. The popularity of vacuum cleaners really increased between 1945 and 1960, after WWII, because of the booming growth of the working class. However, most people couldn’t afford the exorbitant price of about £800-£1000 in those days. Today, the price of around £100, is way more affordable, or most people would be using brooms instead!</li>
        <li>Exceptionally dependable! For most homeowners, their vacuums are their dependable cleaning assistants. One lady from Kent, however, bought her Electrolux way back in 1930, and it served her until way into 2008 when it finally stopped working. The company was so impressed with her story, that they gave her a newer model, free of charge, so she could continue keeping her home squeaky clean!</li>
        <li>A napkin helped to invent the first powered cleaner! British engineer, Hubert Cecil Booth became famous for inventing the first powered cleaner, while visiting a restaurant He placed his napkin on his chair and then, using his mouth, sucked air through it. After doing so, he found a collection of dust on the napkin.</li>
        <li>“Hoover” replaced “vacuum cleaner.” William Henry Hoover was the reason for most people referring to their “Hoover” rather than their vacuum cleaner. This success came about when the company offered clients a ten-day trial of the cleaner free of charge. Naturally, after seeing the incredible capabilities of the machine in their homes during the trial, they immediately purchased one of their own.</li>
        <li>Spangler was the real reason for the success of Hoover! James Murray Spangler, a janitor and asthma sufferer, got the idea of an upright suction sweeper when his health started to take a turn for the worse. Hoover liked his idea, bought the rights for his idea, and the upright vacuum cleaner made its appearance in the industry.</li>
        <li>Best way to keep a home clean. Vacuum cleaners are considered to be the best and most efficient way to clean allergens, dust, and debris from the home. By simply vacuuming regularly your cleaner will remove around 90 to 95% of all the dirt and dust from the floors and carpets in your home.</li>
        <li>An amazing bestseller! It has been found that vacuum cleaners are undoubtedly the device that sells the most all over the world, with the USA being the country with the highest number of purchases!</li>
        <li> Enter the robots! As unbelievable as it seems, the fact is that the first robot cleaner was debuted on Tomorrow World on BBC, as long ago as 1997! The machine had ultrasonic sensors with which it navigated its way on the floors around the home, but it always kept a one-inch space between itself and all objects it approached. This meant that floors were never entirely clean. However, the robot could sense when its bin needed emptying and move to its charging dock as and when it needed to. Its name originated from an extinct arthropod called a Trilobite, which used to move across the floor of the ocean looking for bits of food to suck up.</li>
